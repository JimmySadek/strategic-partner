# Changelog

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Tiered context handoff** — three escalation levels (67% gentle, 72% strong, 77% urgent) replace the old 70/75/85 thresholds that rarely triggered in practice
- **Script generation** — SP now generates runnable `.scripts/*.sh` for deterministic terminal tasks (config edits, installs, setup) alongside `.prompts/` for AI-judgment tasks
- **Deliverable type routing** — decision tree in prompt-crafting-guide to route between scripts, prompts, or both based on task characteristics
- **Script quality standards** — `set -euo pipefail`, pre-flight checks, progress output, idempotent operations
- **RUN-IN-TERMINAL display block** — parallel to the existing COPY-INTO-NEW-SESSION launcher format

### Changed
- Context check cadence tightened from "every 3rd exchange" to "every 2nd exchange after 60%"
- 67% tier is now **visible** to user (inline note) — old 70% "soft trigger" was invisible (internal prep only)
- 77% tier executes handoff immediately — no permission needed, only topic-slug confirmation
- Implementation Firewall now allows `.scripts/` alongside `.handoffs/` and `.prompts/`
- Handoff split-writes now capture pending scripts in addition to prompts
- Continuation prompt template includes "Pending Scripts" section

### Fixed
- Threshold discrepancy between handoff subcommand (60/75/85) and SKILL.md (70/75/85) — unified to 67/72/77
- Stale 70% reference in orchestration-playbook.md
